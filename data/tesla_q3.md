Over two billion miles driven cumulatively on FSD (Supervised)4 as of Q3 with more than 50% on V12

# SUMMARY

We delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second- highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.

Our cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle5 came down to its lowest level ever at ~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles - including more affordable models - which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our "We, Robot" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership and even public transit.

The Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.

Despite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.

(1) Excludes SBC (stock-based compensation), net of tax; (2) Free cash flow = operating cash flow less capex; (3) Includes cash, cash equivalents and investments; (4) Active driver supervision required; does not make the vehicle autonomous; (5)Calculated by dividing Cost of Automotive Sales Revenue by respective quarter's new deliveries (ex-operating leases)
