#### Additional Timing Notes - Knowledge Check questions

Knowledge check (KC) questions are provided throughout the course to check the student's knowledge of
the material that was covered. Instructors can use these KC questions in several ways:

· Conduct a formal classroom exercise in which you go through the questions in a module before
moving on to the next module.

. Sprinkle the questions into the content as you cover the related material for a module

. Let the students review the questions after class as a daily homework assignment. You can set
aside time at the start of each day to answer any questions they have regarding the prior day's
questions. This may be the most feasible option given the tight time constraints that most classes
work under.

It will be left up to each instructor to determine how they want to incorporate the KC questions into their
class.

If you provide students with time to review the KC questions at the end of specific topics and at the end of
each module, you should provide a couple of minutes per question, along with a few extra minutes per
question to respond to student questions or challenges concerning certain questions they may not
understand or whose answers they disagree with. This may add an extra 15 to 30 minutes to complete
each module.


### Labs

The labs must be completed within the lab environment provided by your lab hosting provider. Detailed,
step-by-step instructions are provided for each lab and presented as part of the UI experience within your
lab environment.

At the time the courses were released, the lab instruction had been thoroughly tested and the lab steps
were 100% accurate. However, given the nature of Microsoft's cloud products and the fact that Microsoft
releases UI updates on a regular basis, it's possible that at some point in time, the UI for a given feature
may change so that it no longer matches the lab instruction.

If students encounter lab steps that don't accurately reflect the UI, they'll have to work through the UI to
determine what needs to be done. Typically, UI changes are quite subtle, so hopefully you don't find
yourself in a situation where a feature was completely overhauled.

However, if you do run into major UI changes, challenge your students to work through it, and only offer
help if they definitely need it. Product UI changes will be part of their daily life in today's cloud-centric
world. As IT/Pros, they must learn how to work through such situations.

One thing Microsoft does ask of you is that if you run into situations such as this where lab instructions no
longer match the corresponding UI, please document the issue in the course's GitHub repository. This will
help Microsoft's World-Wide Learning team update the lab instructions to keep them as up to date as
possible. For information on how to submit an issue, please see GitHub User Guide for MCTs.


### Applied Workshop

The Applied Workshop should take up this entire fourth day. Note that if you wish to not deliver the
workshop, you can remove this day. If you do choose to deliver the workshop, please provide your
feedback on your experience as a trainer here.

Please reference the Applied Workshop assets for more information. A brief description of each of those
assets is as follows:

· Applied Workshop Trainer Guide: provides an overview of the workshop and some tips for a
successful delivery.

. Applied Workshop Instructor Deck: it is recommended that trainers lead the workshop using this
deck. Timing, discussion points, and additional trainer notes are provided throughout the slides and
notes.

. Applied Workshop Student Handout: it is recommended that trainers share this file with learners at
the beginning of the day. Feedback has shown that learners gain value from understanding the
expectations for the day. All considerations and discussion points are provided in this handout for
learners to reference.

. Applied Workshop Demo Assets Trainer Guide & Applied Workshop Capstone Solution: provides an
example solution to demonstrate to students and instructions on how to import.
