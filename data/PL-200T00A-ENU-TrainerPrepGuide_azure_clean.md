## Preparation Tasks

Instructors should complete the following tasks to prepare for teaching this course:

. If you have previously taught this class, refer to the course's Change Log. It provides detailed
information on how the course has changed over time. The Change Log is updated for each course
release.

· Review all topics in the student training material in Microsoft Learn (see the link in the Required
Materials section above). You should be well-versed in every topic. If you have previously taught the
course and are comfortable with your knowledge of each topic, focus primarily on the new or updated
topics as outlined in the Change Log.

<!-- PageNumber="Page 6" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="Trainer Preparation Guide: PL-200T00" -->
<!-- PageHeader="April 2025" -->

. Review the PowerPoint slides.

· Be able to speak to each of the talking points on the slides. Some slides include a graphic from
the associated Learn content for the topic. These graphics are provided on the slide so that
you can speak to them to help explain the key talking points in the topic.

. The bulleted items on each slide should NOT be read verbatim to the students. The students
can read the slides themselves. Rather, the bullet points reflect the key information that you
should focus on when discussing each topic. You should use your experience as a subject
matter expert to explain the What, the Why, and the How of each topic. This is your
opportunity to provide a real value-add above and beyond the bulleted talking points.

· Review the Additional Reading links and other linked resources provided in the student training
material. It's recommended that you present key points from this material to supplement the value-
add you provide as an instructor.

. As you prepare for the class, you should review each unit and determine which ones you want to
perform demonstrations of the corresponding product functionality. It's up to you to decide which
product features you want to demonstrate to the class. You should use your experience to identify key
points during the demonstration process. This is an area where you should rely on your experience
as a subject matter expert to provide additional value-add to the students.

. You should review each Knowledge Check (KC) question so that you know why the correct answer is
correct for each question. Students may challenge some of the questions, so you must be able to
address any of those concerns.

. You should perform the labs yourself prior to class so that you become familiar with them and with
any of the difficult points in the lab exercises. This will prepare you for helping students in case they
get stuck.

. This course contains a 1-day Applied Workshop. This workshop will allow you to practice your App
Maker skills by creating an end-to-end solution to solve a problem for a fictitious company. The
solution will include a Microsoft Dataverse database, Power Apps canvas app, and Power Automate
flows.


### Course Timing


#### Daily Agenda

The following agenda provides estimated times to complete each classroom activity. However, the
estimated times may vary depending on the background of your students, which may affect whether you
can move faster or slower through the course material.

Estimated times for each Module include the time to complete:

. The module's PowerPoint slide deck presentation.

· Any pre-defined product demonstrations.

· Time to review Knowledge Check questions (see the section on Additional Timing Notes below).

. Time to complete a classroom discussion activity if a Discussion slide is included in the module
slide deck.

You should adjust the agenda accordingly based on any classroom activities that you personally created or
plan to deliver that are not included in the slides for this course. For example, if you plan to present:

· ad-hoc demonstrations

<!-- PageNumber="Page 7" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="April 2025" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Trainer Preparation Guide: PL-200T00" -->

· review activities

· classroom games

· and so on ...

Note: Each Learning Path/Module activity in the following agenda is the slide deck presentation for that
module.

This course is expected to take 4 full (8 hour) days, including labs (with breaks taken into consideration).
We appreciate any feedback you can provide about timing considerations or scheduling changes that
emerge during a live course.

Labs are divided by module. The PowerPoint slides indicate when labs should be performed. You can find
the labs that correspond to that learning path in the trainer PowerPoint slides in the GitHub repository.

#### Additional Timing Notes - Knowledge Check questions

Knowledge check (KC) questions are provided throughout the course to check the student's knowledge of
the material that was covered. Instructors can use these KC questions in several ways:

· Conduct a formal classroom exercise in which you go through the questions in a module before
moving on to the next module.

. Sprinkle the questions into the content as you cover the related material for a module

. Let the students review the questions after class as a daily homework assignment. You can set
aside time at the start of each day to answer any questions they have regarding the prior day's
questions. This may be the most feasible option given the tight time constraints that most classes
work under.

It will be left up to each instructor to determine how they want to incorporate the KC questions into their
class.

If you provide students with time to review the KC questions at the end of specific topics and at the end of
each module, you should provide a couple of minutes per question, along with a few extra minutes per
question to respond to student questions or challenges concerning certain questions they may not
understand or whose answers they disagree with. This may add an extra 15 to 30 minutes to complete
each module.


### Labs

The labs must be completed within the lab environment provided by your lab hosting provider. Detailed,
step-by-step instructions are provided for each lab and presented as part of the UI experience within your
lab environment.

At the time the courses were released, the lab instruction had been thoroughly tested and the lab steps
were 100% accurate. However, given the nature of Microsoft's cloud products and the fact that Microsoft
releases UI updates on a regular basis, it's possible that at some point in time, the UI for a given feature
may change so that it no longer matches the lab instruction.

<!-- PageNumber="Page 9" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="Trainer Preparation Guide: PL-200T00" -->
<!-- PageHeader="April 2025" -->

If students encounter lab steps that don't accurately reflect the UI, they'll have to work through the UI to
determine what needs to be done. Typically, UI changes are quite subtle, so hopefully you don't find
yourself in a situation where a feature was completely overhauled.

However, if you do run into major UI changes, challenge your students to work through it, and only offer
help if they definitely need it. Product UI changes will be part of their daily life in today's cloud-centric
world. As IT/Pros, they must learn how to work through such situations.

One thing Microsoft does ask of you is that if you run into situations such as this where lab instructions no
longer match the corresponding UI, please document the issue in the course's GitHub repository. This will
help Microsoft's World-Wide Learning team update the lab instructions to keep them as up to date as
possible. For information on how to submit an issue, please see GitHub User Guide for MCTs.


### Applied Workshop

The Applied Workshop should take up this entire fourth day. Note that if you wish to not deliver the
workshop, you can remove this day. If you do choose to deliver the workshop, please provide your
feedback on your experience as a trainer here.

Please reference the Applied Workshop assets for more information. A brief description of each of those
assets is as follows:

· Applied Workshop Trainer Guide: provides an overview of the workshop and some tips for a
successful delivery.

. Applied Workshop Instructor Deck: it is recommended that trainers lead the workshop using this
deck. Timing, discussion points, and additional trainer notes are provided throughout the slides and
notes.

. Applied Workshop Student Handout: it is recommended that trainers share this file with learners at
the beginning of the day. Feedback has shown that learners gain value from understanding the
expectations for the day. All considerations and discussion points are provided in this handout for
learners to reference.

. Applied Workshop Demo Assets Trainer Guide & Applied Workshop Capstone Solution: provides an
example solution to demonstrate to students and instructions on how to import.


### Feedback

In this course, we have provided a framework for you to work with. Take time to prepare and think about
the value that only an instructor can bring to training. We hope to partner with you to provide an
exceptional student experience, and we welcome your feedback.
