# VEHICLE CAPACITY

Production and delivery volumes both returned to year-on-year growth in Q3. We also
produced our 7-millionth vehicle October 22nd. We continued to add to our vehicle lineup by
expanding the options for new vehicle trims and paint for Model 3 and Model Y.


## US: California, Nevada and Texas

Refreshed Model 3 ramp continued successfully in Q3 with higher total production and lower
cost of goods sold quarter-over-quarter. Cybertruck production increased sequentially and
achieved a positive gross margin for the first time. Preparation of the Semi factory continues
and remains on track with builds scheduled to start by the end of 2025.


## China: Shanghai

The Shanghai factory recently achieved two notable milestones: producing its 3-millionth
vehicle in October and exporting its 1-millionth vehicle in September. Costs of goods sold
per vehicle at the Shanghai factory improved sequentially to its lowest level ever.


## Europe: Berlin-Brandenburg

Costs of goods sold per vehicle improved sequentially at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg.
As of Q3, Model Y is the most sold vehicle of any type in 2024 in Sweden, Netherlands,
Denmark and Switzerland, and was the best-selling vehicle in Europe in the month of
September. Additionally, in Q3, Model Y became the best-selling EV (new vehicle sales) of
all time in Norway, which now has over 60,000 units on the road.

Installed capacity # current production rate and there may be limitations discovered as production rates
approach capacity. Production rates depend on a variety of factors, including equipment uptime,
component supply, downtime related to factory upgrades, regulatory considerations and other factors.

# CORE TECHNOLOGY


## Artificial Intelligence Software and Hardware

In Q3, we released the 12.5 series of FSD (Supervised)1 with improved safety and comfort
thanks to increased data and training compute, a 5x increase in parameter count, and other
architectural choices that we plan to continue scaling in Q4. We released Actually Smart
Summon, which enables your vehicle to autonomously drive to you in parking lots, and FSD
(Supervised) to Cybertruck customers, including end-to-end neural nets for highway driving
for the first time. We deployed and are training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at
Gigafactory Texas - where we expect to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.


## Vehicle and Other Software

Our Summer Release included YouTube and Amazon Music as native apps. Parents can now
enable Parental Controls via PIN to apply maximum speed limit, reduce acceleration to Chill,
force-enable safety settings and enable curfew notifications. Other new features include
Hands-Free Frunk, revamped climate controls for Model 3 and Model Y, weather forecast,
air quality and improvements to in-vehicle navigation.
