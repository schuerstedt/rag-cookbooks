## Preparation Tasks

Instructors should complete the following tasks to prepare for teaching this course:

. If you have previously taught this class, refer to the course's Change Log. It provides detailed
information on how the course has changed over time. The Change Log is updated for each course
release.

· Review all topics in the student training material in Microsoft Learn (see the link in the Required
Materials section above). You should be well-versed in every topic. If you have previously taught the
course and are comfortable with your knowledge of each topic, focus primarily on the new or updated
topics as outlined in the Change Log.

. Review the PowerPoint slides.

· Be able to speak to each of the talking points on the slides. Some slides include a graphic from
the associated Learn content for the topic. These graphics are provided on the slide so that
you can speak to them to help explain the key talking points in the topic.

. The bulleted items on each slide should NOT be read verbatim to the students. The students
can read the slides themselves. Rather, the bullet points reflect the key information that you
should focus on when discussing each topic. You should use your experience as a subject
matter expert to explain the What, the Why, and the How of each topic. This is your
opportunity to provide a real value-add above and beyond the bulleted talking points.

· Review the Additional Reading links and other linked resources provided in the student training
material. It's recommended that you present key points from this material to supplement the value-
add you provide as an instructor.

. As you prepare for the class, you should review each unit and determine which ones you want to
perform demonstrations of the corresponding product functionality. It's up to you to decide which
product features you want to demonstrate to the class. You should use your experience to identify key
points during the demonstration process. This is an area where you should rely on your experience
as a subject matter expert to provide additional value-add to the students.

. You should review each Knowledge Check (KC) question so that you know why the correct answer is
correct for each question. Students may challenge some of the questions, so you must be able to
address any of those concerns.

. You should perform the labs yourself prior to class so that you become familiar with them and with
any of the difficult points in the lab exercises. This will prepare you for helping students in case they
get stuck.

. This course contains a 1-day Applied Workshop. This workshop will allow you to practice your App
Maker skills by creating an end-to-end solution to solve a problem for a fictitious company. The
solution will include a Microsoft Dataverse database, Power Apps canvas app, and Power Automate
flows.


### Course Timing


#### Daily Agenda

The following agenda provides estimated times to complete each classroom activity. However, the
estimated times may vary depending on the background of your students, which may affect whether you
can move faster or slower through the course material.

Estimated times for each Module include the time to complete:

. The module's PowerPoint slide deck presentation.

· Any pre-defined product demonstrations.

· Time to review Knowledge Check questions (see the section on Additional Timing Notes below).

. Time to complete a classroom discussion activity if a Discussion slide is included in the module
slide deck.

You should adjust the agenda accordingly based on any classroom activities that you personally created or
plan to deliver that are not included in the slides for this course. For example, if you plan to present:

· ad-hoc demonstrations

<!-- PageHeader="April 2025" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Trainer Preparation Guide: PL-200T00" -->

· review activities

· classroom games

· and so on ...

Note: Each Learning Path/Module activity in the following agenda is the slide deck presentation for that
module.

This course is expected to take 4 full (8 hour) days, including labs (with breaks taken into consideration).
We appreciate any feedback you can provide about timing considerations or scheduling changes that
emerge during a live course.

Labs are divided by module. The PowerPoint slides indicate when labs should be performed. You can find
the labs that correspond to that learning path in the trainer PowerPoint slides in the GitHub repository.
