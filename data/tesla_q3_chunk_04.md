## Battery, Powertrain and Manufacturing

In October, we unveiled our Cybercab and Robovan vehicles, both designed from the
ground up for autonomy - without a steering wheel or pedals. Cybercab will be built on our
next-generation platform which includes a new powertrain with an estimated 5.5 mi/kWh.
This will be our most efficient powertrain yet. In Q3, we produced our 100-millionth 4680 cell
and continued to progress our dry-cathode manufacturing lines.

The Energy business achieved a record gross margin of 30.5% in Q3, a sequential increase
of 596 bps, despite lower Megapack volumes. Powerwall achieved record deployments in
Q3 for the second quarter in a row. Ramp of Powerwall 3 and the Lathrop Megafactory
continued successfully - with Lathrop demonstrating 200 Megapack production (40 GWh
annual run rate) in a single week. As of Q3, over 100,000 Powerwalls were enrolled in Virtual
Power Plant programs, delivering additional financial value to owners while providing much-
needed support to the grid during periods of stress. The Shanghai Megafactory remains on

Energy Generation and Storage


# OTHER HIGHLIGHTS

The Services and Other business achieved a record gross profit in Q3, growing over 90%
year-on-year. Sequential growth in gross profit was driven mostly by higher gross profit
generation from supercharging, service center margin improvement and higher gross profit
generation from Parts Sales and Merchandise. Our Supercharger network continued to
expand in Q3 with over 2,800 new stalls in the quarter, a 22% growth of the network YoY.

track to begin shipping Megapacks in Q1 2025.

Our Energy and Services and Other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of
Tesla. As energy storage products continue to ramp and our vehicle fleet continues to grow,
we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time.

### OUTLOOK


<table>
<tr>
<td>Volume</td>
<td>Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and we believe the next one will be initiated by advances in autonomy and introduction of new products, including those built on our next generation vehicle platform. Despite ongoing macroeconomic conditions, we expect to achieve slight growth in vehicle deliveries in 2024. Energy storage deployments are expected to more than double year-over-year in 2024.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cash</td>
<td>We have sufficient liquidity to fund our product roadmap, long-term capacity expansion plans and other expenses. Furthermore, we will manage the business such that we maintain a strong balance sheet during this uncertain period.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Profit</td>
<td>While we continue to execute on innovations to reduce the cost of manufacturing and operations, over time, we expect our hardware-related profits to be accompanied by an acceleration of AI, software and fleet-based profits.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Product</td>
<td>Plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025. These vehicles will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>This approach will result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times. This should help us fully utilize our current expected maximum capacity of close to three million vehicles, enabling more than 50% growth over 2023 production before investing in new manufacturing lines.</td>

Our purpose-built Robotaxi product will continue to pursue a revolutionary "unboxed" manufacturing strategy.
